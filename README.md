# PinPong Counter

A very simple counter points for iPhone!

Developed just for fun. The idea was born out of a personal need for someone to manage the match.

You can focus on your match and forget about the points! 

Built with XCode for iOS platforms.

:warning: The code was written in 2019, thus some libraries could be updated and the application has to be retested on the newer versions of iOS and XCode.

## Features
- Score announcement with Siri
- Music can be played in the background while announcing the scores
- It can be set the maximum point per match and notify when the ball has to be exchanged between players
- Nice UI
